# Pro JavaScript Bootcamp

To follow along, do this **before** the conference:

1. Install [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/) if on Mac or Linux. Install Node [5.11.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) if on Windows.  
2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/pro-javascript-bootcamp.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/coryhouse/pro-javascript-bootcamp/archive/master.zip)
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.** - `cd pro-javascript-bootcamp`
4. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Run the app.** - `npm start -s` If the app opens in your default browser, you're all set. This is an example of the full development environment we'll build. You can use this as a reference throughout the day.
